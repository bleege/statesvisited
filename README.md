# States Visited
A Map of States that I have travelled to so far.

The map was made using [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/) (design and data management) and then published using [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/).

Interactive Map available at: http://bleege.github.io/statesvisited/
